F0 was determined via n=60 inpedenpent measurements for ThT blank:
F0_mean = 1671.3
SEM0 = 26.5

For each peptide, three self-assembly experiments were performed 
and the resulting samples were measured via the ThT binding assay 
separately, and F_mean and SEM for the peptide were then determined.

Based on the results above, the following expressions were employed to
determine log10(F/F0) and its SEM (in python style):

log10(F/F0) = np.log10(F_mean/F0_mean)
SEM(log10(F/F0)) = np.log10(np.exp(1))*np.sqrt((SEM/F_mean)**2 + (SEM0/F0_mean)**2)
