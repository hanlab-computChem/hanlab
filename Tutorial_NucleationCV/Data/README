Raw data for Rate constants

File: 
-- raw_data_rate_constant.xvg
-- represent raw data of rate constant k and nucleation rate J at different concentration in Fig. 4a in main text
-- including seven columns of data
1st: monomer concentration in unit of mM  
2nd: rate constant k
3rd: supersaturation S=ln(conc/ce) and ce = 0.36 mmol
4th: deltaF = F(n=2) - F(n=1)
5th: alpha = 1+exp(-deltaF)
6th: P(n)
7th: ln(J) = lnalpha + lnP(n) + ln(k) + S


File: 
-- raw_data_timescale.xvg
-- represent raw data of timescales of τ_n and τ_(n_β ) at different concentration in Fig. 4b in main text
-- including three columns of data
1st: monomer concentration in unit of mM  
2nd: timescale of association/dissociation (τ_n)
3rd: timescale of internal structural rearrangements (τ_(n_β ))
