Raw data for Rate constants

File: raw_data_rate_constant.xvg, including seven columns of data
1st: monomer conc in unit of mM  
2nd: rate constant k
3rd: supersaturation S=ln(conc/ce) and ce = 0.36 mmol
4th: deltaF = F(n=2) - F(n=1)
5th: alpha = 1+exp(-deltaF)
6th: P(n)
7th: ln(J) = lnalpha + lnP(n) + ln(k) + S
