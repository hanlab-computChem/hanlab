Step 1: build the file containing the coordinations and free energy.
    Here, we provide an example -- fe-6mmol.xvg.

Step 2: according the file provided in step 1, several imformation can be obtained by pyscript map_network.py.
    ▶︎ python ../../PYSCRIPT/map_network.py fe-6mmol.xvg 6.0
    ● Two inputs: 
         the file in step 1,
         the monomer concentration, whose unit is mM.
    ● Four outputs: 
         crd.xvg: all states in the transition process
         network.xvg: which states have transition
         fe.xvg: the free energy of each state
         br.xvg: the base rate of every transition
         
Step 3: do MC simulations.
    ▶︎ ./../../PROGRAM/anaNetwork_t -kineticNetwork yes -in network.xvg -kineticNetworkPop fe.xvg -baseRate br.xvg \
-source source.xvg -sink sink.xvg -nt 1 -GillespieSingle yes -GillespieOpt seq/mfpt/pfold/seqDetour 100000
    ● Five inputfiles: 
         network.xvg
         fe.xvg
         br.xvg
         source.xvg: the start point of MC simulation
         sink.xvg: the end point of MC simulation
    ● 100000 represents how many MC simulations run
    ● Choice of -GillespieOpt commond decides the output of MC simulation:
         seq: sequences of MC simulation results
         mfpt: mean first-passage time of MC simulation
         pfold: pfold value of each state when running MC simulation
         seqDetour: the detour path when running MC simulation
