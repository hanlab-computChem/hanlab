Step 1: building a file containing the coordinations and free energy.
    Here, we provide an example file -- example-fe.xvg, which contains four columns of data
    -- 1st: n value, the size of a cluster
    -- 2nd: nbeta value, the number of peptides in beta-strand conformation in this cluster
    -- 3rd: m value, the depth of misregistered structures
    -- 4th: free energy

Step 2: building knetic network, catch the states and their free energies in the network and calculate the base rate of each transition between states.
    ▶︎ python ../../PYSCRIPT/map_network.py example-fe.xvg 6.0
    ● Two inputs: 
         the file in step 1,
         the monomer concentration, whose unit is mM.
    ● Four outputs: 
         crd.xvg: all states in the transition process
         network.xvg: which states have transition
         fe.xvg: the free energy of each state
         br.xvg: the base rate of each transition
         
Step 3: doing MC simulations.
    ▶︎ ./../../PROGRAM/anaNetwork_t -kineticNetwork yes -in network.xvg -kineticNetworkPop fe.xvg -baseRate br.xvg \
-source source.xvg -sink sink.xvg -nt 1 -GillespieSingle yes -GillespieOpt seq/mfpt/pfold/seqDetour 10000
    ● Five inputfiles: 
         network.xvg
         fe.xvg
         br.xvg
         source.xvg: the number in the file crd.xvg, and represents the start point of MC simulation
         sink.xvg: the number in the file crd.xvg, and represents the end point of MC simulation
         
    ● 10000 represents how many MC simulations run
    
    ● Choice of -GillespieOpt commond decides the output of MC simulation:
    
         seq: an example is given by exam_seq.xvg
         -- 10000 sequences of MC trajectories without detour
         -- first-passage time of each state on the sequences
         
         mfpt: an example is given by exam_mfpt.xvg
         -- mean first-passage time of 10000 MC simulation
         
         pfold: an example is given by exam_pfold.xvg
         -- pfold value of each state when running MC simulation
        
         seqDetour: an example is given by exam_detour.xvg
         -- 10000 sequences with detour
         -- the time of each state on the sequences
         
    * the time in seq, mfpt and seqDetour output should be divided by 10 to get the actual time, and the unit of time is μs
